his interdisciplinary workshop introduces postgraduate students across schools and disciplines to the fundamentals of system dynamics through computational modelling. Using the accessible R programming language, participants will simulate processes ranging from disease spread to balancing conservation with human development. Through hands-on examples, including differential equation and agent-based models, students will explore the structure, behaviour, and potential futures of complex systems. This workshop is for postgraduate scientists eager to gain confidence and unlock the power of computational modelling, even with limited prior experience."
