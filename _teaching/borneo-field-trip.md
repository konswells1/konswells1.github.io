This residential field course takes students to Borneo, one of the worldâ€™s biodiversity hotspots, to explore the unique ecology of tropical forests. Beyond iconic species such as orangutans and pygmy elephants, students will investigate the extraordinary diversity of plants, birds, insects, and ecosystems that make Borneo globally outstanding. The course combines training in tropical ecology, biodiversity surveys, and experimental design with insights into forest restoration and the socio-economic drivers shaping land use. Students will gain practical research and conservation skills, while experiencing first-hand the challenges and opportunities of working in tropical and international environments.
