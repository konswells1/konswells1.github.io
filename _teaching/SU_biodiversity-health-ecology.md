This postgraduate module explores the emerging field of Biodiversity & Health Ecology at the intersection of humans, animals, and ecosystems. It examines how global change drives infectious disease and pollutant dynamics, and introduces ecological concepts and quantitative tools—such as species distribution modelling, ecological networks, and epidemiological models—equipping students to address contemporary challenges in biodiversity, health, and disease ecology.
