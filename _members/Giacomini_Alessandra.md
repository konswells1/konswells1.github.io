description: "Alessandra has a background in Veterinary Sciences with Master's degrees from the University of Bologne (Italy) on feline oral squamous cell carcinoma and the National Veterinary School of Toulouse and CIRAD (France) on disease spreading risk through livestock trading networks. For her Ph.D., Alessandra studies parasite spread and microbiome-stressor relationships in domesticated and synanthropic species.
This includes the community dynamics and sharing of microbiomes in native and invasive tropical small mammal assembalges in Borneo, and host-parasite-microbiome interactions in feral and domesticated horses in temperate grasslands. Her work is supervised by [Dr Tamsyn Uren Webster](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/staff/t.m.urenwebster/) and Konstans. <br>
Outside of the lab, she enjoys cooking, playing with her dog, and board games."
