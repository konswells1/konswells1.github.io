description: "Konstans began his academic journey with studies in biology and ecology at the University of Freiburg (Germany), the Australian National University (Australia), and the University of Würzburg (Germany). During this formative period, he benefitted from the guidance of [Prof. Andrew Cockburn](https://biology.anu.edu.au/people/andrew-cockburn), [Dr Martin Pfeiffer](https://www.biogeo.uni-bayreuth.de/biogeo/de/mitarbeiter/mit/mitarbeiter_detail.php?id_obj=132043), [Prof. Eduard Linsenmair](https://www.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de/en/zoo3/team/linsenmair/), and the late [Prof. Elisabeth Kalko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth_Kalko), among others. His academic path, shaped by international experience and curiosity about our natural world, led him to develop and pursue original research on the diversity, ecology, and host–parasite interactions of small mammal communities in Borneo. This work formed the foundation of his Master of Science at the University of Würzburg and his Ph.D. at the University of Ulm, and it has since evolved into long-standing collaborations with the national park authorities [Sabah Parks](https://www.sabahparks.org.my/). <br>

After his Ph.D. in 2006, Konstans was involved in implementing the large-scale and long-term German research platform [“Biodiversity Exploratories”](https://www.biodiversity-exploratories.de/en/) as scientific manager and research During this time, he also conducted postdoctoral research on vertebrate functional diversity, based at the University of Ulm.  
Between 2010-2011, he worked as a postdoctoral research fellow with [Prof. Bob O’Hara](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/bob.ohara) at the Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre, on developing hierarchical statistical models to tackle multivariate biological systems. Although the formal appointment was shortened due to personal circumstances, the collaboration continued for several years and proved formative in integrating his field-based ecological expertise with advanced statistical modelling. Other postdoctoral experience include research fellowships on modelling host-parasite interactions and eco-epidemiological dynamics at the University of Adelaide (with [Dr Damien Fordham](https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/damien.fordham), [Prof. Barry Brook](https://discover.utas.edu.au/Barry.Brook), [Prof. Phil Cassey](https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/phill.cassey)) and at Griffith University (with [Prof. Hamish McCallum](https://experts.griffith.edu.au/18706-hamish-mccallum)).  <br>

In 2018, Konstans joined the [Department of Biosciences at Swansea University](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/bioscience/), where he founded the Biodiversity and Animal Health Ecology Group. The group investigates how global environmental change reshapes biodiversity, species interactions, and disease dynamics, combining field ecology with ecological modelling and laboratory work to support evidence-based conservation and planetary health strategies.   <br>
In his spare time, Konstans enjoys being outdoors, often combining sport, travel and photography with his passion for biodiversity and remote ecosystems."
