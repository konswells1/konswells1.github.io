description: "Francisca completed her PhD studies in 2025 at the University of Queensland under the supervision of [Dr Nicholas Clark](https://about.uq.edu.au/experts/15140), [Professor Ricardo Soares Magalhães](https://about.uq.edu.au/experts/1991), [Dr Nicholas Fountain-Jones](https://discover.utas.edu.au/Nick.FountainJones) and Konstans, where she explored the use multivariate modelling for predicting disease risk using co-infection data. Prior to her PhD, she obtained a BSc in biomedical science and a BA in sociology and French in 2018 and was awarded Honours Class I for her project on spatiotemporal modelling of Q fever in Queensland in 2020.
Fran is currently working as a postdoctoral research fellow at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), where she is developing mathematical and computational models to optimise mosquito control strategies that account for local priorities. As part of this work, she is engaging directly with Indigenous stakeholders to ensure that community needs are captured within the modelling framework in a way that is both culturally informed and locally relevant. 
When she’s not working, Fran enjoys travelling, reading and spending time with her cocker spaniel, Arthur.”
