description: "Caitlin holds a BSc in Biological Sciences (Zoology) and an MSc in Global Ecology and Conservation, both from Cardiff University. Her previous research focused on fungal ecology, investigating the phylogenetic and eco-physiological characteristics of Laetiporus sulphureus. Her current work is exploring ways to assess and enhance biodiversity in solar parks through the study of plant-pollinator networks and ecological modelling, aiming to identify key conservation priorities within these environments. Outside of research, Caitlin enjoys spending time in nature, playing rugby, and horse riding."
