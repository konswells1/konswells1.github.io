description: "Molly holds BSc. and MSc degrees from the University of Exeter, where she studied the variation in thermoregulation behaviours in relation to key life history traits in a wild population of crickets. As part of her Ph.D. project, she explores the movement behaviour and distribution vultures, combining high-frequency movement data an citizen science records with modelling for upscaling fine-scale movement data for macroecological approaches. Her work aims to bridge the scale differences between the observed movements of single animals and emergent patterns of species distribution across entire landscapes in times of global change. Her work is supervised by [Prof. Emily Shepard](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/staff/e.l.c.shepard/) and Konstans."
