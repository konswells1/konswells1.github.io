description: "Pádraic holds a degree in Biology with a Year in Industry BSc (Hons) from Swansea University. During his research placement year, spent within Swansea University’s Algal Research Group, he assisted aquacultural natural products research on the bulk cultivation of a marine invertebrate and its endosymbiont algae. Here, he developed a strong interest in the use of molecular and biotechnological tools for species identification and biological diversity characterisation. For his MRes project, he employs molecular and bioinformatic approaches to study the diversity of Haemosporidian parasites in Bornean domesticated chickens and wild birds. His work is supervised by [Dr Tamsyn Uren Webster](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/staff/t.m.urenwebster/) and Konstans."
