We investigate how host-associated microbiomes influence ecological resilience and adaptation to global change. Focusing on wildlife and domestic animals, we study microbiome structure, diversity, and function in relation to environmental stressors such as pollution, invasive species, and disease. Using molecular tools, multivariate and network analyses, we explore microbiome-mediated pathways that shape host health and species persistence. This theme bridges microbial ecology with eco-epidemiology and conservation science, aiming to inform microbiome-based interventions and nature-based solutions that promote ecosystem stability, animal health, and resilience across human-altered landscapes.
