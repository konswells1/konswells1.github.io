## Pathogens in a Connected World

Our research explores the ecology and evolution of infectious diseases across wildlife, human, and environmental interfaces. We focus on host–parasite dynamics, examining how factors like climate, host diversity, and geographical variation shape parasite distribution, abundance, and host specificity. Using field data, meta-analyses, and modelling approaches, we study the parasite sharing among humans and animals, zoonotic spillover risks, the global drivers of parasitic infections in birds and mammals, and mosquito feeding behaviour. Our work also investigates the emergence of novel pathogens and how disease dynamics change across urban–rural gradients and under global change, contributing to improved understanding and management of health risks in socio-ecological systems.
