Our research focuses on modelling infectious disease dynamics across ecological scales from individuals and populations to metapopulations, using dynamic hierarchical models, computational simulations, and forecasting tools. We integrate time-series and spatial modelling, co-infection analysis, and network-based approaches to understand how host demography and the eco-epidemiological interactions of the host and pathogens under changing environmental conditions shape transmission dynamics. Model systems include avian malaria, Tasmanian devil facial tumour disease, and diverse viral and microbial communities in bats, rats, and domestic animals. Our work advances predictive eco-epidemiology to inform surveillance, intervention strategies, and cross-species pathogen management in a rapidly changing world.  Increasingly, we also explore the full spectrum of symbiotic interactions, including transitions between pathogenic and mutualistic states—and their implications for disease control, invasive species management, and the health of wildlife and domestic animals.
