Landscapes under human influence are now subject to multiple, interacting pressures — climate change, land‐use change, habitat fragmentation, invasive species, and more. Resilient Conservation Landscapes are those that are structured and managed so as to retain ecological function, resist perturbations, adapt over time, and continue delivering both biodiversity and ecosystem services. Our group’s work under this theme draws on recent advances in theory, large data set and field work. We monitor and model species distributions and ecological interactions network to explore hotspots of biodiversity and need for management actions, and to assess the impacts of conservation strategies and policies on long-term ecosystem stability and function. Our main model systems are grassland and forest ecosystems in temperate and tropical regions, particularly in the UK/Europe and Borneo, with a research emphasis on birds and mammals as key indicators of ecological change and resilience.
