We are a research group of interdisciplinary ecologists and life scientists with a commitment to understanding how environmental change shapes the structure, function, and health of ecological systems. My research spans temperate and tropical ecosystems, integrating extensive fieldwork with computational and disease ecology to explore how global change alters biodiversity, species interactions, and disease dynamics.

At the core of our work is the ecological modelling of host–parasite interaction networks, species distributions, and community structure — aimed at revealing how biotic systems respond to climate change, habitat fragmentation, invasive species, and other anthropogenic pressures. We are particularly interested in how demographic and epidemiological dynamics, species range shifts, and biogeographic patterns can be used to identify critical processes for optimizing conservation, managing biological invasions, and preventing disease emergence.

By combining trait-based, macroecological, and dynamic modelling approaches, our research bridges ecology, global change biology, and Planetary Health. Through hindcasting and forecasting human–animal–environment interactions, my group takes a systems-level perspective to uncover how past and present ecological dynamics inform biodiversity futures and public health risks. Our goal is to support adaptive, evidence-based policies tailored to real-world environmental change scenarios — contributing to both planetary health and ecological resilience.
