# Short summary
excerpt: "This study uses 17 years of capture–mark–recapture data from South Australia to assess how rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) and myxoma virus (MYXV) and their interactions resulting from coinfections influence the survival and demographic dynamics of European rabbits. By applying a hierarchical and dynamical state-space capture-recapture modelling framework, the analysis reveals that while RHDV infection and mortality peak during winter and spring epidemics, transmission persists year-round, leading to significantly reduced survival in susceptible individuals. Findings also suggest complex interactions between immunity to RHDV and susceptibility to MYXV, with implications for individual survival outcomes. Despite consistent levels of disease-induced mortality over time, the continuous circulation of both viruses may reduce their long-term effectiveness as biocontrol agents. Nonetheless, sustained virulence suggests that RHDV and MYXV remain valuable tools for managing invasive rabbit populations in Australia."
