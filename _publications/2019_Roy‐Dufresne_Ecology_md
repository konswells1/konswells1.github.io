# Short summary
excerpt: "This dataset paper presents a database of rabbit monitoring data from Australia, a comprehensive compilation of over 50 years of georeferenced and date-stamped data on the occurrence (689,000+ records) and abundance (51,000+ records) of the European rabbit across Australia. Developed to address the lack of a unified repository, the database integrates historical and contemporary survey data with environmental and climatic variables, enabling fine-scale analyses of population dynamics and distributional trends. As one of the most ecologically and economically damaging invasive species in Australia, the European rabbit’s monitoring through this open-access resource provides critical insights for managing its impact on biodiversity and agriculture, while also supporting broader research on invasive species ecology.
