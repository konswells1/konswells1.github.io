# Short summary
excerpt: "This study examines over 24,000 records of helminth parasite associations to identify drivers of parasite sharing between wild mammals and domestic animals, including humans. Using hierarchical modeling and species trait data, the work shows that wildlife diet is the strongest predictor of parasite sharing, followed by zoogeographic region and habitat characteristics. Species occupying similar trophic levels are more likely to share parasites, suggesting that future range shifts leading to novel trophic interactions may increase the risk of host shifting. Global risk maps produced from model predictions highlight key areas where emerging parasite transmission at the human–wildlife interface could pose significant threats to health and biosecurity."
