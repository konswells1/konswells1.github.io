# Short summary
excerpt: "Controlling COVID-19 resurgence amid shifting contact networks and social activity remains a major challenge. Using an individual-based metapopulation model across an urban–rural gradient in Wales, this study evaluated the effectiveness of various control strategies. The findings show that isolating symptomatic individuals or imposing local lockdowns has limited impact unless transmission rates are kept consistently low. Moreover, isolating non-symptomatic cases—enabled by robust testing and contact tracing was found to be critical for reducing epidemic size. The model also revealed that regional lockdowns become less effective in urban areas as travel frequency increases, highlighting the need for tailored, multi-scale interventions."
