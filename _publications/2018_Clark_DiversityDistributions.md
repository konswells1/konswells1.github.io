# Short summary
excerpt: "This study investigates how interspecies, climatic, and geographic barriers influence the assembly and invasion potential of avian blood parasite communities across 29 bioregions in Australasia and Oceania. Using data from over 10,000 host individuals and hierarchical modeling, the work reveals that parasite community composition is shaped by host phylogenetic distinctiveness and community connectivity, with more locally distinct parasites found in hosts that are themselves phylogenetically unique. Parasite turnover is jointly influenced by host turnover, climate similarity, and geographic distance. These findings suggest that host dispersal and community structure play key roles in limiting or facilitating parasite establishment, and that shifting host ranges may increasingly erode these barriers, promoting future parasite invasions."
