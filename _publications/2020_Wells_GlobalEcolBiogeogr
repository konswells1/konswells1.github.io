# Short summary
excerpt: "Emerging infectious diseases from mammal-to-human spillover pose a major global health threat. Using a global dataset of over 1,700 viruses and 725 mammal species, this study applied network and trait-based models to explore virus-sharing patterns. Results show that domesticated mammals play a central role in hostâ€“virus networks. Carnivores and bats share primarily RNA viruses, while ungulates share both RNA and DNA viruses. RNA viruses, in particular, show low host specificity and high cross-species transmission potential. These findings underscore the importance of domestic species and viral traits in predicting spillover risk under global change."
