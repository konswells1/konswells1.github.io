# Short summary
excerpt: "The identity of whipworms infecting rodents in Southeast Asia has remained unclear. Through molecular and morphological analysis of specimens collected between 2008 and 2015, this study identified the two new species Trichuris cossoni from Thailand and Trichuris arrizabalagai from Borneo, which were distinct from the commonly reported species T. muris. Phylogenetic analyses revealed clear genetic divergence among the species. These findings suggest a greater diversity of Trichuris than previously recognized and highlight the need to reassess assumptions about host–parasite relationships, particularly where whipworms are used as model organisms in biomedical research."
