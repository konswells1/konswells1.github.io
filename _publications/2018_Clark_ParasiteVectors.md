# Short summary
excerpt: "This study presents the first global synthesis of wild mammal host associations for the invasive cat (Ctenocephalides felis) and dog (C. canis) fleas—two of the most economically important ectoparasites. Using Bayesian hierarchical models, the work reveals that cat fleas infest over 130 wildlife species and act as extreme host generalists, especially in mammals that use human-modified habitats. In contrast, dog fleas exhibit narrower host specificity, primarily infesting canids, felids, and murids. Both species are frequently found on feral and introduced mammals, highlighting the role of invasive reservoir hosts in facilitating parasite spillover. These findings underscore the need to reduce wildlife–domestic animal contact to limit flea transmission across ecological boundaries."
