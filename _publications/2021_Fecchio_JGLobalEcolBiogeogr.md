# Short summary
excerpt: "This study explores the global environmental and ecological drivers of avian haemosporidian (malaria-like) infections, based on more than 53,000 birds individuals from over 2,400 species from a number of zoogeographical regions. Using spatio-phylogenetic Bayesian models, the study explores how host traits, climate, and landscape features influence infection patterns. The findings reveal that while climatic variables show relatively consistent effects on infection risk globally, host-related factors—such as migratory behavior—exert highly variable or even opposing effects across regions. The study also identifies local hotspots of infection in otherwise low-prevalence regions, suggesting that fine-scale environmental factors modulate broader global patterns."
