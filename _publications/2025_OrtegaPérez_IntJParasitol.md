# Short summary
excerpt: "A new parasite, Sarcocystis scandentiborneensis sp. nov., was identified in the muscle tissue of treeshrews (Tupaia minor, T. tana) in  Borneo. Morphologically distinct and genetically unique, the species forms a separate branch within a Sarcocystis clade typically associated with snake–rodent life cycles. Molecular analyses of 18S rRNA and COI genes reveal structural and functional features supporting its species status and evolutionary distinctiveness. The findings raised questions about the origin and true host spectrum of this new species, as related parasite lineages are typically associated with rodents."
