# Short plain-text summary of the publication.
excerpt: "The study explores standardized bird monitoring data from managed grassland and forest systems across Germany, combined with trait and land-use information, to assess how management practices influence species and functional diversity. It finds that management decisions must be tailored to ecosystem and regional context: in forests, tree species and stand age shape diversity and community composition, while in grasslands, higher land-use intensity reduces bird diversity regardless of local practices. The findings suggest that conserving bird diversity and ecosystem function requires integrating local management with landscape-scale planning, general principles for maintaining species richness and functionality, and region-specific land-use practices."
