# Short summary
excerpt: "This study investigates the genetic history and population structure of the summit rat (Rattus baluensis), a montane species endemic to two isolated peaks in Borneo. Genomic analyses reveal that populations on Mt. Kinabalu and Mt. Tambuyukon were once connected but became fragmented following the Holocene retreat of upland forests after the Last Glacial Maximum. These results highlight how climate-driven elevational shifts have shaped biodiversity in tropical mountain refugia. With ongoing warming, suitable habitat is predicted to vanish from Mt. Tambuyukon, posing extinction risk, while Mt. Kinabalu may continue to serve as a critical refuge—emphasizing the conservation importance of high-elevation tropical ecosystems under future climate scenarios."
