# Short summary
excerpt: "The emergence of infectious agents with pandemic potential present scientific challenges from detection to data interpretation to understanding determinants of risk and forecasts. This review describes core directions for expansion of the existing tools and knowledge base, including the use of mathematical models to identify critical directions and paths for strengthening data collection prior to the detection and response to outbreaks of novel pathogens. This work was part of the special feature 'Challenges for Future Pandemics' and a virtual programme on the Infectious Dynamics of Pandemics held at the Isaac Newton Institute in 2020."
