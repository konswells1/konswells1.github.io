# Short plain-text summary of the publication.
excerpt: "This study demonstrates that cross-sectional co-occurrence data alone are insufficient for reliably inferring asymmetric biotic interactions, especially due to the influence of priority effects (the order in which species colonize habitats). Through simulation experiments, it shows that sampling designs which incorporate information on colonisation history can more accurately detect these directional interactions, and it emphasizes caution when interpreting biotic interaction relationships from standard co-occurrence datasets."
