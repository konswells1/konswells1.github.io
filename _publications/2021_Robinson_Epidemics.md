# Short summary
excerpt: "Many emerging infectious diseases, including COVID-19, originate in animal populations before spilling over into humans. This work explores the complexities of modelling disease dynamics at wildlife–human interfaces, emphasizing the need for deeper insight into how these interfaces shift over time, the diversity of pathogens involved, and the ecological and environmental conditions that enable spillover events. This review discusses the need for the development of more sophisticated models that capture the nuanced interplay of ecological, environmental, and anthropogenic processes to better anticipate and mitigate future pandemics. This work was part of the special feature 'Challenges for Future Pandemics' and a virtual programme on the Infectious Dynamics of Pandemics held at the Isaac Newton Institute in 2020."
