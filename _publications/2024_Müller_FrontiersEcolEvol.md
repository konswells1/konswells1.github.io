# Short plain-text summary of the publication.
excerpt: "The study examines how silvicultural management practices influences the diurnal and seasonal patterns of acoustic diversity in managed forests across three regions of Germany. By tracking the Acoustic Diversity Index (ADI) from March to July using generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs), it shows that management intensity affects ADI during the peak vocal activity periods between May and June. The findings underscore the value of acoustic monitoring for understanding biodiversity and ecosystem dynamics in forests."
