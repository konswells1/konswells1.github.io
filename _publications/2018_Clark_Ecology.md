# Short summary
excerpt: "This study highlights the use of Markov random fields (MRFs) and their extension, Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), as powerful tools for inferring interspecific interactions from species co-occurrence data. Unlike traditional approaches, CRFs control for indirect interactions and incorporate environmental covariates, allowing interactions to vary along ecological gradients. Applications to avian blood parasite co-infections and aquatic insect–mosquito larvae co-occurrences demonstrate the method’s utility in capturing context-dependent species associations. This approach advances understanding of community assembly and provides a flexible framework for exploring how interactions shift under changing environmental conditions. An accompanying R package offers practical tools for ecological implementation."
