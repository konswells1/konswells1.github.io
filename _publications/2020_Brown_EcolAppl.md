# Short summary
excerpt: "This study analyzes 41 years of rabbit abundance data from 116 sites across Australia to understand how climatic variability influences population dynamics of Oryctolagus cuniculus. Using a hierarchical Bayesian model that corrects for observation biases, the research links abundance trends to climate, and disease prevalence. The study maps regional and continental "hot spots" of rabbit activity, offering insights for ecologists and pest managers aiming to predict and manage invasive rabbit distributions across Australia at actionable scales."
