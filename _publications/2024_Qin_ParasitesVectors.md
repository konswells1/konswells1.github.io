# Short plain-text summary of the publication.
excerpt: "The study describes Sarcocystis muricoelognathis sp. nov., a newly identified tissue‑cyst forming coccidian with a broad geographic distribution across Thailand, Borneo, and China. It infects both commensal rodents (e.g., Rattus norvegicus) and forest-dwelling species (Maxomys whiteheadi), with consistent cyst morphology and molecular signatures. Phylogenetic analyses based on 18S, 28S, ITS1, and cox1 gene regions confirm its distinction from related species in the S. zuoi complex, showcasing host shifts between commensal and forest small mammal hosts and revealing a broader distribution of rodent-associated Sarcocystis than previously recognised."
