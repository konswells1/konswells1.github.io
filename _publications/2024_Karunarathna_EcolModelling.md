# Short plain-text summary of the publication.
excerpt: "The study applies hierarchical Dynamic Generalized Additive Models (DGAMs) within a Bayesian framework to model and forecast the abundance of the Desert Pocket Mouse (Chaetodipus penicillatus) across 23 years of monthly, multi-site capture data from Arizona, USA. Models were fitted using the mvgam() function in the mvgam package in R. By progressively increasing model complexity and employing custom model-checking functions to account for nonlinear relationships, spatio-temporal dependencies, zero-inflation, and lagged environmental effects, the study demonstrates that nonlinear dynamic models can greatly improve forecasting performance of multivariate ecological time series.
