# Short summary
excerpt: "This paper introduces DGAMs (Dynamic Generalised Additive Models) a modelling framework that combines the flexibility of non‑linear smoothing in GAMs with latent dynamic components to better forecast discrete ecological time series (e.g., counts data as obtained from biological surveys). THis paper links to the mvgam R package (maintained by Nicholas Clark, which implements DGAMs in a Bayesian setup (using Stan or JAGS). By using a hierarchical approach, the paper shows how multiple time series can be analysed jointly, allowing quantification of synchrony or asynchrony in latent temporal trends among series, while still capturing series‑specific predictor effects."
