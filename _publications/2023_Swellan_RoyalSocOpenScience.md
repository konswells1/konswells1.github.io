# Short summary
excerpt: "This study explores how dietary exposure to ethanol—particularly from fruit and nectar—relates to the evolution of the alcohol-processing gene ADH7 across 171 mammalian species. While certain nectarivorous and frugivorous bats show functional adaptations or novel ADH7 variants, this study found no consistent association between diet and ADH7 functional preservation across the phylogeny of the examined mammalian species. The findings suggest that ethanol metabolism may be shaped by complex evolutionary pressures beyond diet alone."
