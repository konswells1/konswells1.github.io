# Short summary
excerpt: "This paper explores how parasite host specificity—an important factor in disease emergence and spillover risk—varies across space and time. It highlights the need to distinguish between a parasite's fundamental and realized host ranges, and discusses modelling approaches that incorporate environmental and evolutionary dynamics to better predict spillover potential under global change. The review outlines how modelling advances to capture spatiotemporal variation in the distributions and biotic interactions of species provide the basis to quantify variation in realized host specificity and progress towards determining how this relates to spillover risk."
