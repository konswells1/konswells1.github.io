# Short summary
excerpt: "This study models how changes in metapopulation structure affect the spread of Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD) in Tasmanian devils. Using an individual-based approach, the authors show that high dispersal, high transmission rates, and large contact distances promote disease spread. Fragmenting populations can reduce disease prevalence, particularly when isolating highly connected or central populations. However, this strategy comes at a cost, in that conditions that reduce the disease impact reduced overall population size and genetic diversity due to disrupted gene flow and limited recolonization. The findings highlight the complex trade-offs in managing disease in wildlife populations if condition that reduce disease spread may negative impact host population that benefit from high connectivity among individuals and populations."
