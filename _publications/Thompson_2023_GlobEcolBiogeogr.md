# Short summary
excerpt: "This study examines how British breeding bird species have shifted their geographic range edges between 1968‑1972 and 2008‑2011, focusing on the interplay among species traits, environmental preferences, and geographical constraints. Using nearly 405,000 citizen-science occurrence records for 135 species, the study shows that geographical boundaries (distance to northern or southern limits of Great Britain) explain most of the variation in range shifts. However, for northern species and Passeriformes, traits like number of predators, habitat specialization, sensitivity to precipitation, body size, and habitat generality also significantly influence rear‐edge (southern) shifts, especially a poleward retreat. The paper highlights that trait‐based predictions are more reliable when accounting for environmental preferences and physical limits, and that differential shifts across trophic levels could reshape ecological interactions under climate change."
