# Short summary
excerpt: "This perspective article explores how global environmental changes—including climate change, habitat loss, biodiversity decline, and increased human-wildlife contact—are reshaping host-parasite dynamics across species. It synthesizes current evidence on shifting patterns of parasite transmission, emergence of zoonotic diseases, and the breakdown of traditional ecological barriers. The paper highlights integrated management strategies aimed at mitigating disease risks in both human and wildlife populations, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary approaches that link ecology, public health, and conservation biology. It serves as resource for understanding how global change drivers influence disease ecology and what potential pitfalls need to be considered when concluding on disease risk from epidemiological or host-pathogen association data."
