# Short summary
excerpt: "This study investigates color vision genes in treeshrews, revealing a unique red-shifted opsin variant in the genus Dendrogale. By comparing gene sequences from multiple species, the research highlights functional visual differences within treeshrews and underscores the need for further study of their visual ecology."
