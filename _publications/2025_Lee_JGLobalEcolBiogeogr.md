# Short summary
excerpt: "This global meta-analysis of over 15,600 mosquito blood meals revealed striking diversity in mosquito host selection. Culex species fed on up to 321 host species, while Aedes and Anopheles showed narrower but still notable ranges. Environmental factors such as temperature and land use were associated with shifts in feeding, highlighting potential plasticity and implications for vector-borne pathogen spillover. Despite the large dataset, predicting global feeding shifts remained uncertain, underscoring the need for more standardized diet studies."
