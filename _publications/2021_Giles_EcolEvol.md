# Short summary
excerpt: "This study examines how commonly used noninvasive under-roost sampling methods for bat viruses, particularly pooling urine on plastic sheets, can bias viral prevalence estimates. Combining field data and simulations on Hendra virus in Australian fruit bats, the study found that common pooled-sheet designs overestimate prevalence by about 3.2 times compared to individual sampling. The study provides nsight into how spatial sample pooling is vulnerable to bias for a wide range of systems in disease ecology, where optimal sampling design is influenced by pathogen prevalence, host population density, and patterns of aggregation."
