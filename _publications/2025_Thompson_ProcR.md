# Short summary
excerpt: "This study investigates the ecological impacts of protected areas on avian food webs in European landscapes. By integrating large-scale field data with network analysis, this study demonstrates, how protection status influences trophic interactions, species richness, and ecosystem resilience. While protected areas generally enhance biodiversity, the effects on food web structure are nuanced, varying with habitat type and conservation strategies. This work provides insights for optimizing protected area management to sustain ecological functions and biodiversity."
