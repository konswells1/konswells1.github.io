# Short summary
excerpt: "This study was the first to demonstrate that Tasmanian devil facial tumour disease (DFTD) is unlikely to drive devils to extinction, challenging long-held assumptions and shifting conservation management strategies. Using individual-based modeling and a decade of field data, the study shows that most disease scenarios result in either pathogen fade-out or long-term host–pathogen coexistence, rather than extinction. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for individual variation and long-term dynamics in wildlife disease forecasting."
